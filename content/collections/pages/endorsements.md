Edmonton's municipal election is coming up on October 20th. 

I'm Troy, a longtime resident of the city, political communicator and podcaster.

I've been following City Council closely for most of my adult life. I've watched this election unfold and after reading platforms and speaking with candidates and voters, these the the individuals who I believe are the best choices for Edmonton's future in the upcoming election.
