I love the Fringe, and I think you should, too.

But the Fringe is overwhelming. It's hard to know where to go, and what to see and with over 200 shows, it's easy to just throw your hands up and not go at all.

But that would be a mistake, so I'm here to help.

I go to dozens of shows a year, so I know what's been good in the past, and is likely to be good this year. My [reviews â†’](/fringe-2025/reviews) represent my opinion (but I have a very good opinions).
