  About the author

  I'm Troy Pavlek. I've been a huge fan of the Edmonton International Fringe Festival for a long time. Over the years I've seen hundreds of shows across several dozen venues. I've seen the greats, and I've seen the really, really bad.

  I'm here to help you find a show to see over the 11-day festival, and share in the wonderful experience that is the **Edmonton Fringe**.

  I also produce video reviews that you can find on each show's review page or you can subscribe on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/troypavlek.politics/), [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@troypavlek) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@troypavlek).

  If you have any questions, or want to drop recommendations, or even share your own review, I'd love to hear from you! You can DM me on any of the above platforms, or [email](mailto:troy@tpavlek.me).

Hi, I'm Troy. I've been Fringing a long time and I'll see a couple dozen shows a year. The Fringe can be overwhelming, but with my reviews, hopefully we can get you to a show you'll like.

The reviews on this page represent _my opinion_ (but I have a very good opinions).
