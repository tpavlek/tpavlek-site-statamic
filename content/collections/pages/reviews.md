I love the Fringe, and I think you should, too.

But the Fringe is overwhelming. It's hard to know where to go, and what to see and with over 200 shows, it's easy to just throw your hands up and not go at all.

But that would be a mistake, so I'm here to help.

I go to dozens of shows a year, so I know what's been good in the past, and is likely to be good this year. And I'll update this page as I see more and more shows throughout the fest. The reviews on this page represent _my opinion_ (but I have a very good opinions).

Many of these reviews have associated video content, if you prefer video, head on over to my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/troypavlek.politics/), [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@troypavlek) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@troypavlek) and subscribe.

Feel free to ask any questions or drop recommendations on any of those platforms or by firing me off an [email](mailto:troy@tpavlek.me)

Finally, I like **stars** in my ratings and recommendations. You can learn about what my ratings mean [by reading more here â†’](/fringe/what-do-ratings-mean)
