What do **stars** and **recommended** mean?

There's a lot of debate about whether to use stars or not in reviews. Opponents of using stars tend to say things like it presents a review as objective, or it discounts parts of the show that were good or bad in service of an overall rating.

And, of course, a bad star rating can tank a show and that sucks.

I agree with all of this, but, at the end of the day, when someone is reading a show I'm reviewing, they want to know if I thought it was _five stars_.

Star ratings give me a quick shorthand to express how much I loved a show, good and bad.

Roughly, the ratings translate as follows:

| Stars    |   Meaning  |
| --- | --- |
|  ★★★★★   |   Go to the show. It's rad. |
| ★★★★☆   | Still go! But I enjoyed it slightly less than a “five star” show. Usually I’ll add some commentary in the review. But we need four stars because when everyone’s super, no one is. |
| ★★★☆☆  | I still tend to enjoy these shows a lot, but there’s usually something about them that requires improvement or holding them back from having a better rating. My downsides may be upsides for you. |
| ★★☆☆☆ | Probably don’t go, unless you have a reason to think I’m wrong. But I don’t think I am. |
| ★☆☆☆☆ | Show’s pretty shit. |
| ☆☆☆☆☆ | I walked out. This has only ever happened twice.
| Recommended | I haven't seen the show yet, but I have reason to recommend it to you |
| Not Recommended | I haven't seen the show yet, and I probably won't. I don't recommend you see this one. |
| Improv          | It's an Improv show, so you get what you get! My personal hot take is that the best way to Fringe is to minimize the amount of improv - which we have all year - and check out some of the unique shows "Fringe" has to offer. But if you want improv, these are the ones. |
