I'm Troy Pavlek. 

I'm an Edmonton-based local politics **communicator, commentator, advocate and analyst** (who also professionally writes software for money, but we don't talk about that).

I co-founded the [Taproot Edmonton podcast Speaking Municipally](https://speakingmunicipally.taprootedmonton.ca) where I hosted over 300 episodes across 7 years helping residents understand everything they need to know about Edmonton City Council in 30 minutes or less.

Currently, I produce shortform video content all about Edmonton municipal politics on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/troypavlek), [TikTok](https://tiktok.com/@troypavlek) and [YouTube shorts](https://youtube.com/@troypavlek/shorts)

I have four cats (it is too many cats).
