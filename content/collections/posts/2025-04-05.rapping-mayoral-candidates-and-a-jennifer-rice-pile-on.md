og_title: 'Rapping Mayoral candidates and a Jennifer Rice pile-on'
og_description: "Jennifer Rice's poor performance this term has made her the most vulnerable incumbent in the city. We're seeing a race shape up to take advantage of that, and unseat her. Plus a mayoral candidate turns to rap to get his message out."
