The mayor''s race is not very exciting, and the driving non-incumbent message in most wards tends to be one of exasperation with the "state of Edmonton". This kind of negative, uninspired campaigning tends to depress turnout. Municipal elections usually land at around 32-35% turnout already, and low turnout favours incumbents which is one reason incumbents historically perform so well municipally.'
