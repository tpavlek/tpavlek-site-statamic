A Fringe classic.

Late Night Cabaret is a late night show (that starts at midnight) that's been a staple at Fringe for the past couple decades.

You get jokes, previews of Fringe shows, guests, games, _free shit_, guest musical acts and a phenomenal band.

There's a lot to like, and I've gone every night for the past few Fringes.

It's hard to imagine taking off a star for something that I've stayed out until 2am for every night for several years, but the past couple years have had bits that really just should have been axed. 

Last year, it was the "band name" contest, which was a bad band name generator putting out names, and then the audience cheering for them. It was dull, underthought, and the crowned band name after last year was thrown out this year.

This Fringe, the bit is they auction off a headshot of Murray Utas in exchange for what people in the room are willing to barter. It's a funny bit on paper, but practically, it's been a waste of time almost every night. Mostly, it's just people in the audience holding up junk they have, while the host runs around unable to see or hear what's on offer, and then the person trades it for something they ostensibly don't want and will recycle.

The bit hit its maximum possible value early on with a ziploc bag of loose potato salad, and has only been disappointing since. I wish they'd bail on it and just give guests extra time, put in another guest, or honestly just let the band play more.

But bad bits that get doubled-down on aside, the show is still a classic, and I'll still be there every night.
