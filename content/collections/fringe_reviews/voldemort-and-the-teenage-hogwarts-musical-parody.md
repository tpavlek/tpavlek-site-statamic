Theatre tends to have a pretty large queer audience, so Harry Potter is a risky pick right now.

But this show is not for TERFs, it's an unlicensed and unauthorized parody and [money from the production](https://www.instagram.com/p/DMwAT1ryMR1) will be donated to trans youth-empowering charities.

So, now that we feel comfortable going, _I'm stoked to go_. This should be a very funny show –– musical dorks (or Dropout fans!) will be excited to notice the talented and hilarious Zach Reino as one of the playwrights.
