This show should be a go for almost everyone.

First, it's worth addressing, this show is not for TERFs. It's an unlicensed and unauthorized parody and [money from the production](https://www.instagram.com/p/DMwAT1ryMR1) will be donated to trans youth-empowering charities.

And, in the content of the show... there's not a lot that the original author would like. Some of the bits and characters feel a bit overwrought in the first quarter, but the show brings it back around and makes it all worth it.

Typically, the "irrelevant musical number from a side character that has no relevance in the show" is the worst part of a musical. In this one, the audience was in stitches.

It's clever, well-performed and full of easter eggs for Harry Potter fans, but perfectly accessible to those who only have a casual relationship with the franchise.

I liked it a lot.
