This is the type of show Fringe was made for.

I saw a preview version of the Jerry Stephenson Story –– the team hadn't yet finished costumes, lighting, and were still working through some transitions. But still, I was fully locked in.

The story is told both through a modern day date at Plaza Bowling Co. (with an actress who is a real Plaza employee!) and the historical story of Jerry Stephenson who really bowled a perfect game there in 1963 (and no one has done so since).

You're seated right on the lanes in the middle of the action, and the whole story unfolds around you. It's incredibly immersive, and I can't tell you how much I wanted to stand-up and cheer every time a strike was bowled. It's infectious.

Yes, Plaza Bowl is a little bit far away from the Fringe grounds, but the trip is worth it. This show cannot –– and will not –– be staged anywhere else. The story has to be told where it really happened. This is the type of scrappy, niche theatre that Fringe was _made_ for.

Make the trip over and don't miss it.

**Bonus**: Plaza is offering $10 off an hour of bowling for anyone who decides to bowl on the day of seeing a showing there. Maybe you're the next Jerry!
