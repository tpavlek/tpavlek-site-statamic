Bias warning: I'm in this show!

However, the show, a riff on the British panel show Taskmaster, cast 15 Edmonton comedians and personalities to show up for three different panels of five.

The contestants are given ridiculous, inane and often embarrassing tasks that they must complete on a time limit, on camera.

A year was spent filming tasks that are edited together and the cast and the Edmaster, who is judging their performance, are all seeing the results for the very first time –– live!

If you saw the show last year, as great as it was, _everything_ about the production has leveled up this year. The venue is better, the screen is gorgeous and large. Mics work much better, and filming and editing has all improved as the producers get better and better at what they do.

Go to this one, honestly more than once. No two shows are the same, there are new tasks, new casts and new antics every single show.

If you want to come see me, the shows I'm in are: 

* Sun, Aug 17, NOON
* Mon, Aug 18, 10:30pm
* Thu, Aug 21, NOON
