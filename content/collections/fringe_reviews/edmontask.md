Bias warning: I'm in this show!

I had such a blast watching Edmontask at the 2024 Fringe that I applied to be a contestant this time around - and I was accepted!

The show is a riff on the British panel show Taskmaster. 15 Edmonton comedians and personalities have spent the better part of the past year doing silly and embarrassing tasks while production films. 

The shows will include live tasks, reacting to the footage, awarding points and much more. Every show is entirely different, so you could go to all nine and get a fully different experience.

The shows I'm in are: 

* Sun, Aug 17, NOON
* Mon, Aug 18, 10:30pm
* Thu, Aug 21, NOON
