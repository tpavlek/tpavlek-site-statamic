A queer take on the biblical creation story... where a Trump-like administration struggles to control Eden.

A very risky premise for the show!

Darkstage productions has produced good work in the past, notably staging Stranger Sings last year which was a tonne of fun.

Plus, this is an original musical! I'm certainly going to check it out.
