Overall, I'd prefer this show with 100% less Trump.

The show, with the premise of a queer take on a biblical creation story, within an incompetent administration of Eden is interesting and something I'd like to see.

What I didn't love was the broad featuring of actual Trump in this musical. Orange face, hair, little hands, "huge", the whole nine yards. At this point, the Trump jokes that can be made, have been made. It feels like stale, retreaded ground.

There's a lot of good to like about the rest of the show. A couple of the numbers are bangers that got stuck in my head, there's a lot of throwaway bits and lines that are very funny. It's a clever script.

But ultimately, the focus on satirizing the sitting president directly ends up making the whole thing feel quite stale.
