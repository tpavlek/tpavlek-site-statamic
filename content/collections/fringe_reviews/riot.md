Monster Theatre is a staple of the Fringe. They consistently bring small-cast, but big-hit shows to the stage to the point where I don't usually bother to read the synopsis.

But, this case, this show is "based on the incredible TRUE STORY of the deadliest theatre riot of all time" where over 30 people died... funny stuff.

But I'm sure I'll see it, and laugh.
