This show is _so_ dumb.

Like the premise of a sketch will be a dumb bit.
And then they'll double down. 
And triple down.
And quadruple down.
And whatever five downs is.

But each time they do, it makes the jokes that came before that much better. It's not a polished, pristine sketch show, but the Grindstone is not the best venue for that type of thing anyway.

It's a bit haphazard, off-the cuff and intimate.

And most importantly dumb. So, so dumb.
