A one man story, that feels like it's told by an entire cast.

The magic in presenting these stories of Irish mythology comes from the pairing of Connor M. McEvoy incredible emoting, paired with a phenomenal live soundtrack provided by Bradley Kallhoff. 

As the story weaves the music grows from lulls into great crescendos, expertly timed to the performance and lighting that builds an entire world out of words.

A Fringe is like a diet, it requires balance. After you go to your improv and musicals and comedies you need to cleanse your palate –– this storytelling show is the perfect way to round out a Fringe.

I walked away having learned actually a considerable amount about Irish mythology, and felt good about it.
