Ostensibly inspired by the viral clips on TikTok and Instagram of standups doing crowd work, two talented comedians Chris Borger and Julian Faid aim to do precisely that: crowd work.

These are two very funny people, and they can probably execute it well. It will probably be funny. But, given how much relies on the crowd (and the work therein) this one has the potential for _catastrophic_ failure.

Which will also probably be funny.
