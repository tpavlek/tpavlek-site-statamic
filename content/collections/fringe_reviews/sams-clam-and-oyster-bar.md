This show made me eat my words (with a side of clams).

I didn't love this troupe's production last year of their original hot dog eating contest show (despite having a synopsis that seemed tailored perfectly for me).

So when I saw this show, again with a title and a synopsis that seemed _perfect_ for me, I dismissed it and didn't buy a ticket.

But then I caved –– and gave it a shot.

I don't usually audibly laugh in shows, but without exaggeration I was laughing most of this show. At some points, literal tears.

Without spoilers, I think the "long arms" bit is the funniest bit I can recall _at any Fringe I've been to_.

The show doesn't come close to taking itself seriously, but what really impressed me was that (with a couple notable exceptions) they never go for the low, "easy" joke. I was consistently surprised as the plot and scenes went in directions I never could have expected.

Unfortunately, and I say this as an absolute lover of musicals and musical comedy, I think the attempts to force a musical format might be holding this team back. Some songs felt a bit forgettable and their inclusion halted otherwise exceptionally funny and escalating bits.

(Some were bangers though, so maybe the music just needs a few more rounds of revision)

But with their showing this year, they've ensured that I'll be buying my tickets for any show they produce next year early.
