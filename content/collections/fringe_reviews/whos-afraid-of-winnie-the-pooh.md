An absolute standout this Fringe. Reading the title and description, it feels like a risky choice, like it might be a cheap play now that Pooh is public domain, Blood and Honey style.

It’s not.

The performances are completely captivating — Pooh especially — and there is *complete* commitment to the bit. No winking or nudging, just full immersion in the world.

A must see.
