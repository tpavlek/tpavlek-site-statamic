It was the "50% less wardrobe" pun that did it for me.

This "low-budget" show, ironically, has a quite large cast, and is in one of the nicest venues at the Fringe.

There's a lot of questions it raises, and I aim to answer them by going. I expect it to be an irreverent romp where about 75% of the jokes land and the other quarter whiff, and I'll be _absolutely there for it_.
