It was the "50% less wardrobe" pun that did got me in the door.

This "low-budget" show, ironically, has a quite large cast, and despite joking about the "bad" costuming, actually does have a decent amount of costumes.

I went in expecting it to be an irreverent romp where about 75% of the jokes land and the other quarter whiff, and that's about right. There's a lot of biting and dark humour, satire, and of course needling the problematic aspects of C.S. Lewis's work.

I did find that even though a lot of the jokes were still hitting, it did go on a bit too long. I went to a 10 o'clock showing, and that's the right time. You want to be a bit tired and loose and have fun with this.

If you're a fan of Narnia, it's definitely worth seeing. If you're not, you may miss a few in-jokes.

But also, if you're a fan of Narnia you might think this is sacrilegious, so maybe better to have a casual relationship with the source material.
