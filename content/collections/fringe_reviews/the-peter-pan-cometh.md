A blending of The Iceman Cometh and Peter Pan.

Last year clevernametheatre put on "Who's Afraid of Winnie the Pooh?", a show that I initially dismissed as likely being trite, hokey and dumb. 

But I got a free ticket, so I went. After the show I tracked down the artists, and paid them. It was that good. I was blown away. It was both funny, smart, emotional and completely held my attention for every second.

They're doing a similar thing this year, taking a child's property and blending it with a piece of classic theatre or literature. And if they even approach the heights they achieved with _Pooh_, you won't want to miss it.
