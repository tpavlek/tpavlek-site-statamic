The absolute madlads have done it again.

Last year clevernametheatre put on "Who's Afraid of Winnie the Pooh?", a show that I initially dismissed as likely being trite, hokey and dumb. 

But I got a free ticket, so I went. After the show I tracked down the artists, and paid them. It was that good. I was blown away. It was both funny, smart, emotional and completely held my attention for every second.

So Peter Pan Cometh has a lot to live up to and big shoes to fill, and it absolutely does.

They took a dense, long piece of classic theatre, The Iceman Cometh, and set of children's characters in Peter Pan and then gave an absolute 110% performance. And they delivered.

I breathed in at the start of the show, and by the time I exhaled, an hour had passed and we were at the end. I was mesmerized.

Just go to this show. Even if the premise doesn't appeal to you, even if you're unfamiliar with the source material, this is just one to experience.
