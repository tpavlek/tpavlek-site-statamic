This show has a lot of heart.

We don't often get a lot of media about how much divorced dads love their kids, and this one has some great storytelling around that.

Ultimately, though, I didn't love it.

There were some interesting ideas and individual scenes were interesting. The performer playing Dracula delivered his lines impeccably.

But much of the play felt like characters on stage speaking exposition at each other. There was a lot to get through, and a lot of the times the characters getting through it were shouting –– it got a little tiring.

The show was set in St. Albert, and landmarks from the city were inserted in and played for laughs, but ultimately none of the characters were really "St. Albertan" and the setting didn't have much effect other than for wink-and-nod references. Any other location could have been swapped in without any effect on the storytelling or characters.

There's a lot of potential in this show, and you can tell the entire cast is having fun with it and giving it their all.

It just feels a little underbaked.
