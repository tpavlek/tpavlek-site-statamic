Rat Academy has earned its reputation as an instant classic at Fringe.

In this followup, Gnaw and Order, Dayna and Katie do the impossible: they _improve_ on what's come before.

This show has everything you know and love about Rat Academy: incredible physical comedy, whip-quick improv from Fingers, an unrelentingly cute Shrimp and unhinged crowd work.

Where it elevates the past work is a story that emotionally connects. I saw wet eyes. In a dumb show about rats.

By the time you see this review, the show will have been sold out. So this is your reminder that if it gets held over or comes back next year: don't sleep on these tickets.
