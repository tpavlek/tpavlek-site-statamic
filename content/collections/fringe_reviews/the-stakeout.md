Martin Dockery's hit show is back.

I didn't get to see this one last time it was here, and I'm glad I got the chance this time.

The premise of the show "Two guys on a stakeout of two guys that are on a stakeout of them" sounds a lot more stoner-comedy than the show actually is.

It's funny, clever and well-performed. The scripted bits are tight with real "who's on first" and pun-based energy.

But the show does actually have a meaningful message and is a bit of a thinker. It's art, not just a dumb show as the premise might indicate.
