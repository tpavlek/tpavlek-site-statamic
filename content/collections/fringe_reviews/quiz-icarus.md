Nam and Aaron are Jeopardy contestants.

This show is pretty uncomplicated. The two of them told the story of how they get on Jeopardy, their experience on the show, and then Nam competes in a Jeopardy game against two audience contestants (who have been earning headstarts the whole show) for $100.

If you want to be one of the people participating in the game, show up early and get in the front row.

For a superfan of Jeopardy like me, this was a fun show.

It was also fun to put a face to the name of Aaron, who I remember seeing on Jeopardy (and yelling at him through my screen).

Classic Fringe fare.
