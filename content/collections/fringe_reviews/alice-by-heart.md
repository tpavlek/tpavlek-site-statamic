Taking place in 1941, post-blitz this musical is a WWII era riff on Alice in Wonderland, but the plot is not the important part here.

This is a musical staged by the Scona Alumni Theatre Company, who does fantastic work, and is sure to be a great show. In 2024, they staged a production of Evil Dead that was an absolute blast.
