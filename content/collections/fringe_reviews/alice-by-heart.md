This is an absolutely gorgeously produced show.

Costuming, performances, set design all of it is dressed to the nines.

But here's the rub: I just don't think the show is very good. Perhaps mic issues contributed to this, some of the micing was inconsistently working and there's a lot of crosstalk in British accents.

But, if I'm being honest, given any particular scene in this show I had about a 35% chance of knowing what was going on. And the scenes where I did know what was going on, much of the music felt forgettable. I wasn't humming anything on the way home.

On one hand, it feels wrong to ding this excellent staging, as I've come to expect from the Scona Alumni Theatre Company, but at the end of the day, I just don't think I enjoyed the experience.

That said, I also know that I don't love Alice in Wonderland in general, so perhaps I was fated not to enjoy this one.

As an aside, as I was doing the Scona double-header waiting for the next show after Alice, the director, Linette Smith, chatted with me and was gushing about how she loves the work that she does so much that it never feels like work.

I too, love her work! I just didn't love this show.

(The entire run of this show is sold out though anyway, so positive or negative I guess reviews for this one are a wash!)
