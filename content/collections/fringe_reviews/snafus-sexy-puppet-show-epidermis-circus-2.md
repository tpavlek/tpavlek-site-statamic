Ingrid's done it again.

I've seen both past versions of this show: Ingie's Fingies and Epidermis Circus - both were a joy, and the second was only an improvement on the first. The third in this series was a blast.

This show gives the people more of what they want: Baby Tyler. He plays a starring role in some funny and inventive bits, but of course just like every year there's more creative characters you can root for and laugh at.

If I was to complain about anything in this show, I was a little disappointed that we didn't get as wide variety of finger-puppet cast. Gummy Bear Generals, lumps of clay, I remember rooting for these weird and silly heroes, but there were fewer characters overall this year.

But, the characters we had were a riot.

If you can manage tickets for this one, you should (but, forewarning, this one is definitely less kiddo-friendly than previous years)
