I've seen both past versions of this show: Ingie's Fingies and Epidermis Circus - both were a joy, and the second was only an improvement on the first.

Ingrid is incredibly creative and it's magical what she does to create expansive scenes before your eyes out of just fingers and random props.

The _storytelling_ is the secret sauce of this show. You're made to _care_ about random gummy bears or balls of clay. Past shows were told essentially as a clip show of vingettes, and I found myself longing to see what each of the cast of characters got up to next.

You absolutely must see this show.
