I make no secret that I'm pretty bearish on improv at Fringe.

There's so many great, innovative and unique shows that you can't access any time of the year, and Edmonton has a strong improv scene that you can access around the year.

But, the appeal of this show is Colin Mochrie (he's back!) and honestly that's why my review is so poor.

At my showing, Colin honestly didn't do very much.

I get that improv is a team sport and if the show was all about him that would be just as bad, but... the very first game Colin "swapped out" and hosted, and it went on for some time. I very frequently saw him in the wings while other improvisers were doing their thing, and when there was a line for punchlines he only stepped forward once to make a joke.

I came to see Colin, and I left feeling unfulfilled. Probably should have just hit up something non-improv instead.
