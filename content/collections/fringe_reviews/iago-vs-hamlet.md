When you get a bunch of theatre dorks, and give them a small budget at a scrappy festival, the inevitable result is taking some highbrow works into lowbrow places.

That's what I expect of Iago vs Hamlet, which is a returning show to the Fringe after previously receiving rave reviews.

The main performers you might recognize from other hit shows like AWOL or The War of 1812 - both of which were great enough to warrant a benefit of the doubt recommendation here.
