This show riffs on Shakespeare in all the best ways.

I'm not a big fan of the Bard. I think we value far too highly four-hundred year old plays that are the equivalent of modern airplane books, and that the only reason Shakespeare is so pervasive and universally referenced is because we _force_ it to be.

But, as a result of this forced education I got the references!

And this is a well-written play of Iago and Hamlet trying to kill each other, while also just making jokes and riffing about the situation the whole time.

It's fun, clever and engaging.
