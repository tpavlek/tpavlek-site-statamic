This one is sure to sell out (spoiler: it did)

Last year, Uniform Theatre put on an excellent production of High School Musical. This year, they brought that same energy into a Sondheim musical about assassins and would-be assassins of United States Presidents.

Most everything about the show was great, I started to list specific performances before realizing I was just listing the cast.

One major downside was the venue. Artshub Ortona, while absolutely gorgeous is not an ideal venue for a musical. Tall, uncovered brick walls and concrete floors wreak havoc.

My partner, who is not well-versed on American politics or Assassins didn't really enjoy the show much, so perhaps a quick brush up on Wikipedia would be ideal if this is not your fort√©.

Well, I guess in theory.

This review doesn't matter. You can't see the show.

It's sold out.

I saw it and you didn't. Neener neener boo boo.
