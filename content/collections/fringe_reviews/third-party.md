This is a really fun show.

There's nothing groundbreaking about this show. They don't try to do incredible setpieces or innovative production. It's just three actors, a couple phones and insurance fraud in a chicken and waffle shop.

And that's OK. They know what works, and they execute it well. It doesn't drag, it keeps moving and I was interested in everything happening. The jokes land well.

If you're looking for a show where you pay $20 and in exchange enjoy yourself for an hour, this show does _exactly that_.

Just don't sit in the southeast corner of the restaurant like I did. You'll miss quite a bit of the physical comedy in the first half.
