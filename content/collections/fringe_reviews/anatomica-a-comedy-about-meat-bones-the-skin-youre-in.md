The show describes itself as "a gloriously deranged Ted-Talk by a wanna-be scientist who dropped out of college to go to clown school" –– and that's apt.

Amica Hunter is an incredible inventive performer and their stage presence is completely captivating. I truly didn't know what was going to happen next. There's standup, clowning, stuff approaching body horror, which all comes together into a very weird experience that's so quintessentially "Fringe"
