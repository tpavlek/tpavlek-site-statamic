A one-man musical about the Zombie apocalypse is an ambitious premise.

And this show has every ounce of potential to be a phenomenal show, but for me it falls short.

The good here: there's a lot of really good music and Damon Pitcher gives 100% in playing every character in the show. He nails the songs, he's a charismatic performer and it feels like he "fills" the space even though he's just one dude. There are some very funny bits and physical comedy.

But there are couple key ways the show falls short. The first is that despite Damon's charismatic performer, the protagonist of this show behaves _deeply unlikably_ in almost every instance. But the show doesn't seem to acknowledge that or play him as an anti-hero. It feels like we're supposed to root for a guy who frankly, sucks.

Most of the show is spent with our protagonist complaining about how everyone else in his life is an asshole. And we all know the adage about when "everyone else is the asshole".

This extends to the plot as well. Most of the play we're supposed to be rooting for the protagonist to get into the good books for a stand-in for Jeff Bezos/Elon Musk, while he neglects his wife, family and responsibilities. A _lot_ of time is spent on this premise (that could be spent on more interesting things, like a Zombie apocalypse)

When the hero succeeds or there's a big number to celebrate it, I found it very hard to get excited because, and I cannot stress this enough, the hero _really sucks_.

It's a crying shame too, there's some really good numbers that could be slotted into a very good show with minimal changes to the music. Flow/Renaissance is a certified bop, and De-Zombified definitely works as a finale number. As I was biking home I was imagining all the ways you could slot those songs into a rewritten show and they'd be absolutely _killer_.

So, this one isn't for me this year. But with rewrites, a few more test audiences (and probably 20 minutes trimmed off the runtime!) this could be a great show someday.
