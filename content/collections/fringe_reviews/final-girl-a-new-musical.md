Straight Edge Theatre consistently produces _best of Fringe_ material.

This year was no exception. 

This is the company brought you Krampus, Imaginary Friend and Cult Cycle. It's a horror comedy about teenagers on a remote weekend trip encountering a murderer (as one does).

I previewed it briefly during rehearsal before Fringe and gave it a blind five stars –– after seeing their sold-out opening night I have no reason to change that assessment.

The show is performed wonderfully, all the cast are giving it all (even if two of them were literally sprinting from ArtsHub Ortona where they just performed 90 minutes in Assassins). The choreo is excellent and the songs are well-written, well-performed and funny.

The story _does_ leave something to be desired, but in my view the story is just a vehicle to deliver bits... and all the bits _deliver_.

The show has already sold out it's three openers, so if you want tickets you'd best get them now. And you should want tickets.
