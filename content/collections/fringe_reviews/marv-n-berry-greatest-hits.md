A staple in the Edmonton sketch scene (for ten years!) this is Marv N' Berry's anniversary show which, they allege, contains their greatest hits.

If you've seen them before, it's probably worth a nostalgic laugh. If you haven't, then you're getting the cream of the crop on your first time. Win-win!
