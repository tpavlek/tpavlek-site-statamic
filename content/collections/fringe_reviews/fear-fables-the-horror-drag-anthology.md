If you're a fan of drag, this is one to go to.

Last year's Sterling-nominated presentation was put together in under a month after a last minute venue became available, and still led to great reviews and several sold-out shows.

This year, the braintrust of Emmonia and Mørtis X have had the whole year to prep. Expect great –– and unhinged, horror –– drag performances.
