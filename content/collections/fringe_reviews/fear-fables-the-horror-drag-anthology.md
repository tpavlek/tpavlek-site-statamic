Fear Fables is back for another year of spooky, campy, horror-inspired drag.

I went to the (sold out!) opening night of this show and the host, Emmonia, said "my brother-in-law Troy is in the audience right now so I'm expecting a 10/10 nepotism review"

Ask and ye shall receive (but my scales are out of five stars!)

Last year's Sterling-nominated presentation was put together in under a month after a last minute venue became available, and still led to great reviews and several sold-out shows.

This year, the braintrust of Emmonia and MÃ¸rtis X have had the whole year to prep. It shows. They've put together a brand new show, and this time they're sticking with one static cast of performers, which really helps with thematic cohesiveness.

If you're a fan of drag, this is one to go to.
